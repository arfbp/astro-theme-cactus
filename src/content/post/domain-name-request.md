## Step 3: Legal Review and Pricing

- During the **initial legal review**, the legal team will mark the estimated cost of the domain.  
- If the estimated cost **exceeds 10,000**, the legal department will **contact you directly** to confirm whether you wish to proceed.  
- After you confirm, the process continues to the registration stage.

## Step 4: Domain Registration

Once the initial review is complete and all approvals are obtained:

- The **legal department will coordinate with the domain registrar** platform to proceed with the registration.  
- After successful registration, the legal department will **notify you** and **send the final details** for confirmation.
